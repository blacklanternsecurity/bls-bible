## Plugins

https://danielmiessler.com/blog/10-essential-firefox-plugins-for-the-infosec-professional/

1. XSS Me ([Addon Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7598))
- This plugin discovers all the fields on the current page, and gives you the option to launch targeted attacks on each field, or to launch all of its attacks against all fields.
2. SQL Inject Me ([Addon Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7597))
- From the same group as XSS Me, this plugin finds all fields on the page you’re on and let’s you launch the most common SQL injection attacks against them.
3. Live HTTP Headers ([Addon Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3829))
- See exactly what your browser is sending and receiving in real-time.
4. User Agent Switcher ([Addon Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59))
- Change your user-agent on the fly. So, you can make it look like you’re coming from Lynx running on AIX, or like you’re the GoogleBot.
5. Web Developer
- Modify all sorts of options related to the site you’re viewing. Disable scripting, modify forms, etc.
6. Tamper Data ([Addon Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/966))
- Lets you view and tamper with the data that’s being passed between you and the web server.
7. ASnumber ([Addon Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2072))
- Find the Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the network that your current site is served from. Simple. Useful.
8. Firebug ([]())
- Gives you a developer’s view into the page you’re viewing, showing exactly what scripts are running, what the stylesheet is, etc. Oh, and let’s you change them and see what the result would be. Not really a security thing, but strong enough to be included in a list of musts.
9. Cookie-Editor ([Addon Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/))
Proxy Addon:
10. Foxy Proxy
