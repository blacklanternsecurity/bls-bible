# NFS (Port 2049)
### References
* Install Linux NFS Tools like "showmount"
	
		apt install nfs-common

### Overview
* NFS is a client/server system that allows users to access files across a network and treat them as if they resided in a local file directory.
* <details><summary>Execution (Click to expand)</summary><p>Enumeration
	* Show open NFS shares

			showmount -e hostname/ip_address
		* Although -a is intended to show all, -e will show NFS shares that may otherwise not be shown.
	* mount the share

			mount -t nfs target:/directory_found_exported /local_mount_point
* NFS Brute Force
	* Interact with NFS share and try to add/delete
	* Exploit and Confuse Unix
* Examine Configuration Files
	* `/etc/exports`
	* `/etc/lib/nfs/xtab`
* Compaq/HP Insight Manager
	* Port 2301, 2381
* HP Enumeration
	* Authentication Method
		* Host OS Authentication
		* Default Authentication
			* Default Passwords
	* Wikto
	* Nstealth
* HP Bruteforce
	* Hydra
	* Acunetix
* Examine Configuration Files
	* path.properties
	* mx.log
	* CLIClientConfig.cfg
	* database.props
	* pg_hba.conf
	* jboss-service.xml
	* .namazurc

### Enumeration

* nmap scripts
	* List NFS exports and check permissions

			nfs-ls
	* Like showmount -e

			nfs-showmount
	* Disk statistics and info from NFS share

			nfs-statfs
* metasploit

		scanner/nfs/nfsmount #Scan NFS mounts and list permissions

### Mounting

* To know **which folder** has the server **available** to mount you an ask it using:

		showmount -e <IP>
* Then mount it using

		mount -t nfs [-o vers=2] <ip>:<remote_folder> <local_folder> -o nolock
* Try NFS Version 2 (No Auth required)
	* Example

			mkdir /mnt/new_back
			mount -t nfs [-o vers=2] 10.12.0.150:/backup /mnt/new_back -o nolock

## Permissions
* If you mount a folder which contains **files or folders only accesible by some user** \(by **UID**\). You can **create** **locally** a user with that **UID** and using that **user** you will be able to **access** the file/folder.

## NSFShell

* To easily list, mount and change UID and GID to have access to files you can use [nfsshell](https://github.com/NetDirect/nfsshell).

[Nice NFSShell tutorial.](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/using-nfsshell-to-compromise-older-environments/)

* Config files
	* `/etc/exports`
	* `/etc/lib/nfs/etab`
