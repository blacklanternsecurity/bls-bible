## Overview

* Several TTPs occur naturally through the use of tools and attacks described in this guide, and sometimes multiple

* <details><summary>Web Services (SOAP/XML) (Click to expand)</summary><p>
	* The documentation uses **WSDL** format and is usually saved in the `?wsdl` path like `https://api.example.com/api/?wsdl`
	* An example of this documentation can be found in [http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx](http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx) (WSDL document in [http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?wsdl](http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?wsdl)) and you can see an example request calling the `Add` method in [http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?op=Add](http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?op=Add)
	* For parsing these files and create example requests you and use the tool **SOAPUI** or the **WSDLer** Burp Suite Extension.

## Tools

	* Imperva's customizable API attack tool takes an API specification as an input, generates and runs attacks that are based on it as an output.

## Process

* <details><summary>SOAP, XML (Click to expand)</summary><p>
	* XXE ([XXE Attack Guide](Testaments_and_Books/Redvelations/Apps_and_Services/Web/Attacks/XML_External_Entities_(XXE).md))
		* Uncommon, but check if user input `DTD Declarations` are allowed.
		* Try to insert payloads via `CDATA` tags, provided XML is still correct
* CORS ([Guide](Testaments_and_Books/Redvelations/Apps_and_Services/Web/Attacks/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing_(CORS)/00-0_Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing_(CORS).md))
* Patterns
	* Search for API patterns inside the api and try to use it to discover more.
	* If you find  `_/api/albums/<album_id>/photos/<photo_id>_`, you could try also things like:  `_/api/posts/<post_id>/comment/_` (Note posts and comment positions)
	* Use some fuzzer to discover this new endpoints.
* Add parameters
	* Something like the following example might get you access to another userâ€™s photo album:

			_/api/MyPictureList --> /api/MyPictureList?user_id=<other_user_id>_
* Replace parameters
	* You can try to **fuzz parameters** or **use** parameters **you have seen** in a different endpoints to try to access other information
	* For example, if you see something like: _/api/albums?**album\_id=\<album id>**_
	* You could **replace** the **`album_id`** parameter with something completely different and potentially get other data: _/api/albums?**account\_id=\<account id>**_
* Parameter pollution

		/api/account?id=<your account id> -->  /api/account?id=<your account id>&id=<admin's account id>
* Wildcard parameter
	* Try to use the following symbols as wildcards
	* `**\***`, `**%**`, `**\_**`, `**.**`
	* ` /api/users/\*`
	* `/api/users/%`
	* `/api/users/\_`
	* `/api/users/.`
* HTTP request method change
	* You can try to use the HTTP methods: **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, INVENTED** to try check if the web server gives you unexpected information with them.
* Request content-type
	* Try to play between the following content-types (bodifying acordinly the request body) to make the web server behave unexpectedly:
		* **x-www-form-urlencoded** --> user=test
		* **application/xml** -->  \<user>test\</user>
		* **application/json** -->  {"user": "test"}
		* Parameters types
			* JSON, unexpected data types

					{"username": "John"}
					{"username": true}
					{"username": null}
					{"username": 1}
					{"username": \[true]}
					{"username": \["John", true]}
					{"username": {"$neq": "lalala"}}
		* any other combination you may imagine
* If you can send **XML** data, check for **XXE injections**.
* If you send regular POST data, try to send arrays and dictionaries:
	* `username\[]=John`
	* `username\[$neq]=lalala`
* Play with routes

		/files/..%2f..%2f + victim ID + %2f + victim filename
* Check possible versions
	* Old versions may be still be in use and be more vulnerable than latest endpoints
		* `/api/v1/login`
		* `/api/v2/login`\
		*  `/api/CharityEventFeb2020/user/pp/<ID>`
		*  `/api/CharityEventFeb2021/user/pp/<ID>`
* API Endpoint Lists/Wordlists

#### Checklist

* Authentication
	* Don't use `Basic Auth`. Use standard authentication instead (e.g. [JWT](https://jwt.io/), [OAuth](https://oauth.net/)).
	* Don't reinvent the wheel in `Authentication`, `token generation`, `password storage`. Use the standards.
	* Use `Max Retry` and jail features in Login.
	* Use encryption on all sensitive data.
	* JWT (JSON Web Token)
		* Use a random complicated key (`JWT Secret`) to make brute forcing the token very hard.
		* Don't extract the algorithm from the header. Force the algorithm in the backend (`HS256` or `RS256`).
		* Make token expiration (`TTL`, `RTTL`) as short as possible.
		* Don't store sensitive data in the JWT payload, it can be decoded [easily](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io).
	* OAuth
		* Always validate `redirect_uri` server-side to allow only whitelisted URLs.
		* Always try to exchange for code and not tokens (don't allow `response_type=token`).
		* Use `state` parameter with a random hash to prevent CSRF on the OAuth authentication process.
		* Define the default scope, and validate scope parameters for each application.
* Access
	* Limit requests (Throttling) to avoid DDoS / brute-force attacks.
	* Use HTTPS on server side to avoid MITM (Man in the Middle Attack).
	* Use `HSTS` header with SSL to avoid SSL Strip attack.
	* For private APIs, only allow access from whitelisted IPs/hosts.
* Input
	* Use the proper HTTP method according to the operation: `GET (read)`, `POST (create)`, `PUT/PATCH (replace/update)`, and `DELETE (to delete a record)`, and respond with `405 Method Not Allowed` if the requested method isn't appropriate for the requested resource.
	* Validate `content-type` on request Accept header (Content Negotiation) to allow only your supported format (e.g. `application/xml`, `application/json`, etc.) and respond with `406 Not Acceptable` response if not matched.
	* Validate `content-type` of posted data as you accept (e.g. `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, `application/json`, etc.).
	* Validate user input to avoid common vulnerabilities (e.g. `XSS`, `SQL-Injection`, `Remote Code Execution`, etc.).
	* Don't use any sensitive data (`credentials`, `Passwords`, `security tokens`, or `API keys`) in the URL, but use standard Authorization header.
	* Use an API Gateway service to enable caching, Rate Limit policies (e.g. `Quota`, `Spike Arrest`, or `Concurrent Rate Limit`) and deploy APIs resources dynamically.
* Processing
	* Check if all the endpoints are protected behind authentication to avoid broken authentication process.
	* User own resource ID should be avoided. Use `/me/orders` instead of `/user/654321/orders`.
	* Don't auto-increment IDs. Use `UUID` instead.
	* If you are parsing XML files, make sure entity parsing is not enabled to avoid `XXE` (XML external entity attack).
	* If you are parsing XML files, make sure entity expansion is not enabled to avoid `Billion Laughs/XML bomb` via exponential entity expansion attack.
	* Use a CDN for file uploads.
	* If you are dealing with huge amount of data, use Workers and Queues to process as much as possible in background and return response fast to avoid HTTP Blocking.
	* Do not forget to turn the DEBUG mode OFF.
* Output
	* Send `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header.
	* Send `X-Frame-Options: deny` header.
	* Send `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'` header.
	* Remove fingerprinting headers - `X-Powered-By`, `Server`, `X-AspNet-Version`, etc.
	* Force `content-type` for your response. If you return `application/json`, then your `content-type` response is `application/json`.
	* Don't return sensitive data like `credentials`, `Passwords`, or `security tokens`.
	* Return the proper status code according to the operation completed. (e.g. `200 OK`, `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `405 Method Not Allowed`, etc.).
* CI & CD
	* Audit your design and implementation with unit/integration tests coverage.
	* Use a code review process and disregard self-approval.
	* Ensure that all components of your services are statically scanned by AV software before pushing to production, including vendor libraries and other dependencies.
	* Design a rollback solution for deployments.
