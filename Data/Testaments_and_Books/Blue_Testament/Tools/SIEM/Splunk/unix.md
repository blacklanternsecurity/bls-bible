__============ CRYPTOMINING ============__

__PROBLEM STATEMENT__ - How long was a browser engaged in crypto-mining activity?

        Date format in logs event â†’ Mon Aug 20 14:05:20 2018

__APPROACH__ 

        index=botsv3 source=cisconvmflowdata dh=*coinhive*
        | eval epochtime_start=strptime(fst, "%a %B %d %H:%M:%S %Y")
        | eval epochtime_end=strptime(fet, "%a %B %d %H:%M:%S %Y")
        | eval duration=round(epochtime_end-epochtime_start)
        | table sa dh pn epochtime_end epochtime_start duration
        | stats sum(duration) as miningTime

__STEPS EXPLAINED__ 

1. Search ciso logs for all events that have a destination host including *coinhive*
2. eval - Convert fst to UNIX epochtime
3. eval - Convert fet to UNIX epochtime
4. eval - Calculate the duration of the connection for each event
5. table - Show data
6. stats - Sum each duration to get the total mining time
