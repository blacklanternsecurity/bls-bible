# T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery

### Attacks
* System Network Configuration Discovery on Windows
	* Overview
Identify network configuration information

Upon successful execution, cmd.exe will spawn multiple commands to list network configuration settings. Output will be via stdout.

```cmd
ipconfig /all
netsh interface show interface
arp -a
nbtstat -n
net config
```

### Attacks
* List Windows Firewall Rules
	* Overview
		* Enumerates Windows Firewall Rules using netsh.
		* Upon successful execution, cmd.exe will spawn netsh.exe to list firewall rules. Output will be via stdout.
	* Command

		```cmd
		netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all
		```

* System Network Configuration Discovery
	* Overview
		* Identify network configuration information.
		* Upon successful execution, sh will spawn multiple commands and output will be via stdout.
	* Command

		```sh
		if [ -x "$(command -v arp)" ]; then arp -a; else echo "arp is missing from the machine. skipping..."; fi;
		if [ -x "$(command -v ifconfig)" ]; then ifconfig; else echo "ifconfig is missing from the machine. skipping..."; fi;
		if [ -x "$(command -v ip)" ]; then ip addr; else echo "ip is missing from the machine. skipping..."; fi;
		if [ -x "$(command -v netstat)" ]; then netstat -ant | awk '{print $NF}' | grep -v '[a-z]' | sort | uniq -c; else echo "netstat is missing from the machine. skipping..."; fi;
		```

* System Network Configuration Discovery (TrickBot Style)
	* Overview
		* Identify network configuration information as seen by Trickbot and described here https://www.sneakymonkey.net/2019/10/29/trickbot-analysis-part-ii/
		* Upon successful execution, cmd.exe will spawn `ipconfig /all`, `net config workstation`, `net view /all /domain`, `nltest /domain_trusts`. Output will be via stdout.

		```cmd
		ipconfig /all
		net config workstation
		net view /all /domain
		nltest /domain_trusts
		```

* List Open Egress Ports
	* Overview
		* This is to test for what ports are open outbound.  The technique used was taken from the following blog:
			* https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/poking-holes-in-the-firewall-egress-testing-with-allports-exposed/
		* Upon successful execution, powershell will read top-128.txt (ports) and contact each port to confirm if open or not. Output will be to Desktop\open-ports.txt.
	* Command

		```powershell
		$ports = Get-content #{port_file}
		$file = "#{output_file}"
		$totalopen = 0
		$totalports = 0
		New-Item $file -Force
		foreach ($port in $ports) {
		    $test = new-object system.Net.Sockets.TcpClient
		    $wait = $test.beginConnect("allports.exposed", $port, $null, $null)
		    $wait.asyncwaithandle.waitone(250, $false) | Out-Null
		    $totalports++ | Out-Null
		    if ($test.Connected) {
		        $result = "$port open" 
		        Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green $result
		        $result | Out-File -Encoding ASCII -append $file
		        $totalopen++ | Out-Null
		    }
		    else {
		        $result = "$port closed" 
		        Write-Host -ForegroundColor Red $result
		        $totalclosed++ | Out-Null
		        $result | Out-File -Encoding ASCII -append $file
		    }
		}
		$results = "There were a total of $totalopen open ports out of $totalports ports tested."
		$results | Out-File -Encoding ASCII -append $file
		Write-Host $results
		```

	* Cleanup

	```powershell
	Remove-Item -ErrorAction ignore "#{output_file}"
	```

* Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Subnet Objects
	* References
		* http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/
		* https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/04/pick-six-intercepting-a-fin6-intrusion.html
	* Overview
		* Adfind tool can be used for reconnaissance in an Active directory environment. This example has been documented by ransomware actors enumerating Active Directory Subnet Objects

#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| adfind_path | Path to the AdFind executable | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1087.002&#92;src&#92;AdFind.exe|

```cmd
#{adfind_path} -f (objectcategory=subnet)
```

#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: AdFind.exe must exist on disk at specified location (#{adfind_path})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path #{adfind_path}) {exit 0} else {exit 1} 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1087.002/src/AdFind.exe" -OutFile #{adfind_path}
```

### Attacks
* Qakbot Recon
	* Overview
A list of commands known to be performed by Qakbot for recon purposes

#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| recon_commands | File that houses list of commands to be executed | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1016&#92;src&#92;qakbot.bat|

```cmd
#{recon_commands}
```

# SNACs (Stale Network Address Configurations)
IP addresses on the LAN that are no longer in use but still have active connections being attempted.  These can be a quick way to get hashes, etc. when LLMNR/NBT-NS is disabled.

## EavesARP
1. Start EavesARP
~~~
# passive mode will not send any packets
# so SNACs are not confirmed and hostnames are not displayed
$ ./eavesarp.py c -i eth0
~~~
~~~
# enable arp (-ar) and dns (-dr) resolution
# only display verified-stale hosts (-so)
$ ./eavesarp.py c -i eth0 -ar -dr -so
~~~
2. Start Responder/ntlmrelayx/wireshark
~~~
# Analyze mode
$ responder -I eth0 -A
~~~
3. Assign known-stale IPs to network adapter and wait for traffic
~~~
for i in $(cat known_stale.txt)
do
    echo $i
    ip addr add $i dev eth0
    sleep 10
    ip addr del $i dev eth0
done
~~~
