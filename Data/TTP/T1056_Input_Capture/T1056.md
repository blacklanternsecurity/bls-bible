## Input Capture

#### Linux
* [How to Monitor Keyboard Keystrokes Using ‘LogKeys’ in Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/how-to-monitor-keyboard-keystrokes-using-logkeys-in-linux/)
* [logkeys - a GNU/Linux keylogger](https://github.com/kernc/logkeys)
	* logkeys is a linux keylogger. It is no more advanced than other available linux keyloggers, notably lkl and uberkey, but is a bit newer, more up to date, it doesn't unreliably repeat keys and it shouldn't crash your X. All in all, it just seems to work. It relies on event interface of the Linux input subsystem. Once completely set, it logs all common character and function keys, while also being fully aware of Shift and AltGr key modifiers.

* [SKeylogger](https://github.com/gsingh93/simple-key-logger)
	* SKeylogger is a simple keylogger. I had previously been using a few other open source keyloggers, but they stopped working when I upgraded my operating system. I tried to look through the code of those keyloggers, but it was undocumented, messy, and complex. I decided to make my own highly documented and very simple keylogger.

## Man in the Browser
* [Man in the Browser - ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1185)
	* Adversaries can take advantage of security vulnerabilities and inherent functionality in browser software to change content, modify behavior, and intercept information as part of various man in the browser techniques.
	* A specific example is when an adversary injects software into a browser that allows an them to inherit cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificates of a user and use the browser as a way to pivot into an authenticated intranet.
	* Browser pivoting requires the SeDebugPrivilege and a high-integrity process to execute. Browser traffic is pivoted from the adversary's browser through the user's browser by setting up an HTTP proxy which will redirect any HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This does not alter the user's traffic in any way. The proxy connection is severed as soon as the browser is closed. Whichever browser process the proxy is injected into, the adversary assumes the security context of that process. Browsers typically create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly. With these permissions, an adversary could browse to any resource on an intranet that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has sufficient permissions, such as Sharepoint or webmail. Browser pivoting also eliminates the security provided by 2-factor authentication.
