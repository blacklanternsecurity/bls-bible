			* Completes Google Dorks passively; needs research but seems promising; requires proxy to avoid Google bot detection
	* Overview
		* Google accepts these parameters
			* `site:<subdomain>.<domain>.<tld>/<dir>` - return only results at the specified address.
			* "In" - restrict the results containing the specified parameter in:
				* `intitle:` the title
					* `allintitle` - all words in the title
				* `inurl:` the url
					* `allinurl` - all words in the url
				* `intext:`
					* `allinttext` - all words in the text
				* `inanchor:` - anchor text. Inbound links tie to anchors.
					* Example: `inanchor:apple iphone`
					* `allinanchor` - all words in the anchor
			* `info:`
			* `link:`
			* `cache:` - Google's cached version of the site
			* Symbols before words:
				* `-<word>` - Exclude word
				* `"<word>"` - Exact match between quotes
				* `<number>..<number>` - range of numbers, such as years. Results are inclusive of the specified numbers.
			* `OR` - Combine search results
			* `(<word>)` - Group multiple terms or search operators
				* Example: (blue OR black) dog
			* `filetype:` or `ext:` - Interchangeable; limit by extension.
			* `related:` - Find sites related to the domain.
			* `<word1> AROUND(<number>) <word2>` - Proximity search. Find pages containing two words or phrases within X words of each other. For this example, the words “apple” and “iphone” must be present in the content and no further than four words apart.
				* Example: `apple AROUND(4) iphone`
