# T1593
* recon-ng
	* Overview
		* Known Issues
			* "marketplace install all" does not work (entire process dies if even one module fails to install)
			* Case-sensitive searches for hosts and domains. Leads to duplicate entries
			* Unintuitive syntax ("db insert" ??)
			* Requires multiple passes with lots of manual review and duplicated effort, since only one module can be run at a time
			* it collects telemetry on module usage
	* Usage

		```bash
		$ recon-ng

		# there are no modules installed by default
		> marketplace refresh
		> marketplace search
		> marketplace install all

		> workspaces create EvilCorp

		> db insert companies
		> db insert domains

		> modules load recon/domains-hosts/certificate_transparency
		> info
		> options set SOURCE evilcorp.com
		> run
		```
