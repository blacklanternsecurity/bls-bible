	- The LaZagne project is an open source application used to retrieve lots of passwords stored on a local computer. Each software stores its passwords using different techniques (plaintext, APIs, custom algorithms, databases, etc.). This tool has been developed for the purpose of finding these passwords for the most commonly-used software.
2. [PCredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz)
	- This tool extracts Credit card numbers, NTLM(DCE-RPC, HTTP, SQL, LDAP, etc), Kerberos (AS-REQ Pre-Auth etype 23), HTTP Basic, SNMP, POP, SMTP, FTP, IMAP, etc from a pcap file or from a live interface.

### Attacks
* Automated Collection Command Prompt
	* Overview
Automated Collection. Upon execution, check the users temp directory (%temp%) for the folder T1119_command_prompt_collection
to see what was collected.

```cmd
mkdir %temp%\T1119_command_prompt_collection >nul 2>&1
dir c: /b /s .docx | findstr /e .docx
for /R c: %f in (*.docx) do copy %f %temp%\T1119_command_prompt_collection
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
del %temp%\T1119_command_prompt_collection /F /Q >null 2>&1
```

### Attacks
* Automated Collection PowerShell
	* Overview
Automated Collection. Upon execution, check the users temp directory (%temp%) for the folder T1119_powershell_collection
to see what was collected.

```powershell
New-Item -Path $env:TEMP\T1119_powershell_collection -ItemType Directory -Force | Out-Null
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.doc | % {Copy-Item $_.FullName -destination $env:TEMP\T1119_powershell_collection}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell

### Attacks
* Recon information for export with PowerShell
	* Overview
collect information for exfiltration. Upon execution, check the users temp directory (%temp%) for files T1119_*.txt
to see what was collected.

```powershell
Get-Service > $env:TEMP\T1119_1.txt
Get-ChildItem Env: > $env:TEMP\T1119_2.txt
Get-Process > $env:TEMP\T1119_3.txt
```
