Subdomain Takeover

1. Discover vulnerable subdomains

		go get -v github.com/haccer/subjack
		subjack -w all.txt -v -o results.txt -a
1. In the case of a vulnerable Azure subdomain:
	* make note of the region, e.g., `vulnerable.evilcorp.com` --> `vulnerable.<southcentralus>.cloudapp.azure.com`
	* create a new droplet in the same region
	* change the `DNS name label` to match the vulnerable name
	* verify that it worked:
		`dig vulnerable.evilcorp.com`
