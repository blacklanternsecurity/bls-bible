# T1047 - Windows Management Instrumentation
### From a Windows Machine
* WMI Reconnaissance Users
	* Overview
		* An adversary might use WMI to list all local User Accounts. 
		* When the test completes , there should be local user accounts information displayed on the command line.
	* Command

		```cmd
		wmic useraccount get /ALL /format:csv
		```

* WMI Reconnaissance Processes
	* Overview
		* An adversary might use WMI to list Processes running on the compromised host.
		* When the test completes , there should be running processes listed on the command line.
	* Command

		```cmd
		wmic process get caption,executablepath,commandline /format:csv
		```

* WMI Reconnaissance Software
	* Overview
		* An adversary might use WMI to list installed Software hotfix and patches.
		* When the test completes, there should be a list of installed patches and when they were installed.
	* Command

		```cmd
		wmic qfe get description,installedOn /format:csv
		```
* WMI Reconnaissance List Remote Services
	* Overview
		* An adversary might use WMI to check if a certain Remote Service is running on a remote device. 
		* When the test completes, a service information will be displayed on the screen if it exists.
		* A common feedback message is that "No instance(s) Available" if the service queried is not running.
		* A common error message is "Node - (provided IP or default)  ERROR Description =The RPC server is unavailable" if the provided remote host is unreacheable
	* Command

		```cmd
		wmic /node:"#{node}" service where (caption like "%#{service_search_string}%")
		```

* WMI Execute Local Process
	* Overview
		* This test uses wmic.exe to execute a process on the local host.
		* When the test completes, a new process will be started locally .A notepad application will be started when input is left on default.
	* Command

		```cmd
		wmic process call create #{process_to_execute}
		```
	* Cleanup

		```cmd
		wmic process where name='#{process_to_execute}' delete >nul 2>&1
		```
* WMI Execute Remote Process
	* Overview
		* This test uses wmic.exe to execute a process on a remote host. Specify a valid value for remote IP using the node parameter.
		* To clean up, provide the same node input as the one provided to run the test
		* A common error message is "Node - (provided IP or default)  ERROR Description =The RPC server is unavailable" if the default or provided IP is unreachable
	* Command

		```cmd
		wmic /user:#{user_name} /password:#{password} /node:"#{node}" process call create #{process_to_execute}
		```

	* Cleanup

		```cmd
		wmic /user:#{user_name} /password:#{password} /node:"#{node}" process where name='#{process_to_execute}' delete >nul 2>&1
		```
* Create a Process using WMI Query and an Encoded Command
	* References
		* You should expect to see notepad.exe running after execution of this test. [Solarigate Analysis from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/18/analyzing-solorigate-the-compromised-dll-file-that-started-a-sophisticated-cyberattack-and-how-microsoft-defender-helps-protect/)
	* Overview
		* Solarigate persistence is achieved via backdoors deployed via various techniques including using PowerShell with an EncodedCommand
		* Powershell -nop -exec bypass -EncodedCommand <encoded command>
		* Where the –EncodedCommand, once decoded, would resemble:

			```pwsh
			Invoke-WMIMethod win32_process -name create -argumentlist ‘rundll32 c:\windows\idmu\common\ypprop.dll _XInitImageFuncPtrs’ -ComputerName WORKSTATION
			```
		* The EncodedCommand in this atomic is the following: Invoke-WmiMethod -Path win32_process -Name create -ArgumentList notepad.exe
	* Command

		```cmd
		powershell -exec bypass -e SQBuAHYAbwBrAGUALQBXAG0AaQBNAGUAdABoAG8AZAAgAC0AUABhAHQAaAAgAHcAaQBuADMAMgBfAHAAcgBvAGMAZQBzAHMAIAAtAE4AYQBtAGUAIABjAHIAZQBhAHQAZQAgAC0AQQByAGcAdQBtAGUAbgB0AEwAaQBzAHQAIABuAG8AdABlAHAAYQBkAC4AZQB4AGUA
