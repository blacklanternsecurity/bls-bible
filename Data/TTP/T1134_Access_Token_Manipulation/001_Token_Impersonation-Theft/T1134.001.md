# T1134.001 - Token Impersonation/Theft

### Attacks
* Named pipe client impersonation
	* Overview
Uses PowerShell and Empire's [GetSystem module](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/v3.4.0/data/module_source/privesc/Get-System.ps1). The script creates a named pipe, and a service that writes to that named pipe. When the service connects to the named pipe, the script impersonates its security context.
When executed successfully, the test displays the domain and name of the account it's impersonating (local SYSTEM).

### Attacks
* `SeDebugPrivilege` token duplication
	* Overview
Uses PowerShell and Empire's [GetSystem module](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/v3.4.0/data/module_source/privesc/Get-System.ps1). The script uses `SeDebugPrivilege` to obtain, duplicate and impersonate the token of a another process.
When executed successfully, the test displays the domain and name of the account it's impersonating (local SYSTEM).
