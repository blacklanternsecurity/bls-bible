### Attacks
* Security Software Discovery
	* Overview
Methods to identify Security Software on an endpoint

when sucessfully executed, the test is going to display running processes, firewall configuration on network profiles
and specific security software.

```cmd
netsh.exe advfirewall  show allprofiles
tasklist.exe
tasklist.exe | findstr /i virus
tasklist.exe | findstr /i cb
tasklist.exe | findstr /i defender
tasklist.exe | findstr /i cylance
```

<br/>
<br/>

### Attacks
* Security Software Discovery - powershell
	* Overview
Methods to identify Security Software on an endpoint

when sucessfully executed, powershell is going to processes related AV products if they are running.

```powershell
get-process | ?{$_.Description -like "*virus*"}
get-process | ?{$_.Description -like "*carbonblack*"}
get-process | ?{$_.Description -like "*defender*"}
get-process | ?{$_.Description -like "*cylance*"}
```
