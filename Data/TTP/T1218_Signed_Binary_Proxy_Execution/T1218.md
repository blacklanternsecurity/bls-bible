### Overview

You can use any .NET Binary with a `XXX.exe.config` file that will allow execution of a dll in the same directory.

### Process
1. Copying a `.NET` Binary into a user controlled directory (`%AppProfile%` or `C:\Users\Public\Downloads`)
1. Writing out the `BinaryName.exe.config` file (Sample below)
1. Writing out a DLL file compiled specifically for getting a call back (Sample Below)

**The value= tag needs to match up with the output of the dll. Additionally, the privePath= tag has no impact of execution, whatever local directory you wrote to should work.**

### Examples

1. Config File
1. Compile

		C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\csc.exe /target:library /out:uevmonitor.dll type.cs
		set APPDOMAIN_MANAGER_ASM=uevmonitor, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null
		set APPDOMAIN_MANAGER_TYPE=MyAppDomainManager
		set COMPLUS_Version=v4.0.30319
