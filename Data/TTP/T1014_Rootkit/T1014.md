# T1014 - Rootkit

### Attacks
* Loadable Kernel Module based Rootkit
	* Overview
	* Requirements
		* Administrative Privileges 
```sh
sudo insmod #{rootkit_path}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```sh
sudo rmmod #{rootkit_name}
```

### Attacks
* Loadable Kernel Module based Rootkit
	* Overview
	* Requirements
		* Administrative Privileges 

```sh
sudo modprobe #{rootkit_name}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:

```

### Attacks
* Windows Signed Driver Rootkit Test
	* Overview
This test exploits a signed driver to execute code in Kernel.
This example was curated from a blog that utilizes puppetstrings.exe with the vulnerable (signed driver) capcom.sys. 
The capcom.sys driver may be found on github. A great reference is here: http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/28.html
SHA1 C1D5CF8C43E7679B782630E93F5E6420CA1749A7
We leverage the work done here:
https://zerosum0x0.blogspot.com/2017/07/puppet-strings-dirty-secret-for-free.html
The hash of our PoC Exploit is
SHA1 DD8DA630C00953B6D5182AA66AF999B1E117F441
This will simulate hiding a process.

	* Requirements
		* Administrative Privileges 

```cmd
#{puppetstrings_path} #{driver_path}
```
